    <h3 style="color: white;">Tips for Effective Business Planning</h3>
    <p style="color: white;">
        1. Clearly define your business idea and be able to succinctly articulate it. Know your mission.
        <br>
        2. Examine your motives. Make sure that you have a passion for owning a business and for this particular business.
        <br>
        3. Be willing to commit to the hours, discipline, continuous learning and the frustrations of owning your own business.
        <br>
        4. Conduct a competitive analysis in your market, including products, prices, promotions, advertising, distribution, quality, service, and be aware of the outside influences that affect your business.
        <br>
        5. Seek help from other small businesses, vendors, professionals, government agencies, employees, trade associations and tradeshows. Be alert and ask questions.

    <h3 style="color: white;">Tips on Building a Sound Business Plan</h3>
    <p style="color: red;">
        1. Write a business plan with a complete financial and marketing plan.
        <br>
        2. Your marketing strategy should be built around your strengths, your competitor's weaknesses and your customers' desires.
        <br>
        3. Test the reality of your business-know why it will work and how you will make it work. Think your business through step by step.
        <br>
        4. Allow at least two hours every week for thinking and planning. Do not allow anything to interfere with this time. You run the business. Don't let it run you.
        <br>
        5. Establish an annual operating plan. Review it and update it monthly with appropriate employees.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3 style="color: white;">Tips on Technology Planning</h3>
    <p style="color: white;">
        1. Create a master plan for technology, just as you would draw up a business plan, a budget, or a marketing plan.
        <br>
        2. Design the plan so that it supports your business strategy and goals. Use it to guide technology buying decisions.
        <br>
        3. Think of technology purchases as investments, not costs. And, remember, when you have an overall plan, your company avoids wasting money on unnecessary purchases or quick fixes.
        <br>
        4. Start by determining your company's needs. Look at what problems need to be solved and how technology can help.
